## Break Down The Code

I came across this line countless times whenever I look for coding tips. Yet, it leaves me with another question

> ***How can I break down a code?***

I heard an answer to a similar type of question from Dr. K — a well-respected psychiatrist online. He said, it's like *explaining a task to a younger version of oneself.*

 If I can explain how I will code in simpler terms and make someone who has no context understand it, then I can follow through that.

 ### Nursing Code Plan

 I created a template to break down my code. Then, after months of using it, I realised it looked like the Nursing Care Plans that I used to write for my patients for a case study! :boom:


 :woman_health_worker: My nursing side of the brain steep in to the coding side unconsciously. :laughing:

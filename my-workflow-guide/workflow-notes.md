I converted the files to .md from .html. It's easier to fill with details for now. Design will be for later.

1. I adopt YYYY-MM-DD format, per ISO 8601.
2. Update git message format from <code> file_name | code_version | message_type -> *(optional scope)*  : description </code> to:

> <code> file_name -> *(optional scope)*  | code_version | message_type  : purpose </code>

**REASON:** 
- Clearer file path
- Emphasize on ***purpose***

3. Stick with American English in documentation to ensure global consistency.

1. Create a new branch every code version.
2. Update git commit message format to *file_name/message type(optional_scope): purpose*

**REASON:**
- Updated format is more commonly used. It increases readability by familiarity.

1. Started to read ***" The Complete Middle School Study Guide: Everything You Need to Ace Computer Science and Coding In One Big Fat Notebook"*** by Grant Smith. 

**REASON**
- To strengthen my CS foundation — mainly software to hardware compatibility.

2.  I sorted my Developer Progress Notes starting March every year.

**REASON**
- I was born in March, a month in which I reflect on my life, and being a developer has become a significant part of who I am.
